# Contributing to Esque

I do not expect any contributions on this project as it is insignificant, but if somebody decides to spend their time on this project, I always welcome contributions, no matter how small and insignificant they may seem to anybody else. This is not a race and every line of code contributes to the goal of a working system.

## Documentation

While I try to document a few things in the `Documentation/` subfolder, I fail often. The same is true for comments. (Even though, I believe that my code can be read). If anyone has too way much time on their hands and somehow finds pleasure in documenting functions, they could do this.
